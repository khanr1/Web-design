          <h2> Biography</h2>
          <p>Hedy Lamarr (/ˈheɪdi/; born Hedwig Eva Maria Kiesler, November 9,
            1914 – January 19, 2000) was an Austrian-born American film actress
            and inventor.

            At the beginning of World War II, she and composer George Antheil
            developed a radio guidance system for Allied torpedoes, which used
            spread spectrum and <a id="tribute-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency-hopping_spread_spectrum" target="_blank">frequency hopping technology </a>to defeat the threat of jamming by the Axis powers. Although the US Navy did not adopt the technology until the 1960s, the principles of their work are arguably incorporated into Bluetooth technology and similar to methods used in legacy versions of CDMA and Wi-Fi. This work led to their induction into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2014.
